Transform order fulfillment with data-driven Excel dashboards, slicing through delays and boosting efficiency to unprecedented levels.

BUSINESS PROBLEM
At Streamline Logistics Solutions, we encounter several pressing challenges within our order fulfillment
process:
Mounting Order Backlogs: Our current routing and resource allocation processes have resulted in a growing backlog of orders, compromising delivery timelines and, in turn, customer satisfaction.
Visibility Gap: Customers often find themselves lacking real-time updates on their order progress, leading to communication gaps and rising dissatisfaction.
Customer Frustration: The increasing frequency of customer complaints regarding delayed deliveries and suboptimal communication channels is beginning to cast a shadow on our reputation for reliability.
 Escalating Costs: Operational expenses are on the rise due to overtime payments and the necessity for expedited shipping to clear order backlogs.

 Data Description
This case study contains a single dataset and it comprises of;
Order ID: A unique identifier for each customer order.
Delivery Address: The address to which the order is to be delivered.
Order Timestamp: The date and time when the order was placed (e.g., "2023-09-01 08:00").
Order Status: The current status of the order (e.g., "In Progress" or "Completed").
Driver ID: A unique identifier for each driver assigned to deliver orders.
Vehicle Info: Information about the delivery vehicle used for the order.
Current Location: The current location of the delivery driver during order delivery.
Delivery Time: The total time taken for delivery, measured in minutes (e.g., "120 min").
Delays: Any delays that occurred during the delivery, measured in minutes (e.g., "15 min").

Aim of the Project
This project's primary objectives are to develop an Excel interactive dashboard that provides unparalleled visibility into our order fulfillment processes. Through this, we aim to:
Efficiently allocate delivery resources based on order volume and location.
Monitor order progress and proactively identify potential delays.
Enhance customer communication with timely delivery status updates.
Reduce order backlogs and operational costs.
Elevate overall customer satisfaction and safeguard our reputation as an industry leader.
